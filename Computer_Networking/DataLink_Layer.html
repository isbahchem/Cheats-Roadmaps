    <h2>Ethernet and MAC Addressess</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Ethernet</h3>
      <p>
        The protocol most widely used to send data accross individual links.
      </p>
      <h3>MAC Addressess</h3>
      <p>
        A globally unique identifier attached to an individual network
        interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a 48 bit number normally represented by six groupings of two
        hexadecimal numbers.
      </p>
      <h3>Organiztionally Unique identifier (OUI)</h3>
      <p>The first three octets of a MAC Address</p>
      <p>
        Ethernet uses MAC Address to ensure that the data it sends has both an
        address for the machine that sent the transmission, as well as the one
        the transmission was intended for.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        A <strong style="color: darkred;">Unicast</strong> transmission is always meant for just one
        receiving address.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the least significant bit in the first octet of a destination address
        is set to zero, it means that the ethernet frame is intended for only
        the destination address.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the least significant bit in the first octet of a destination address
        is set to one, it means you are dealing with a <em>multicast</em> frame.
      </p>
      <p>Ethernet Broadcast address is all F's</p>
      <p>FF:FF:FFFF:FF:FF</p>

      <h3>Disecting an Ethernet Frame</h3>
      <h4>Data Packet</h4>
      <p>
        An all encompassing term that represents any single set of binary data
        being sent accross a network link.
      </p>
      <h4>Ethernet Frame</h4>
      <p>
        A highly structured collection of information presented in a specific
        order.
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr class="ethernet-frame-head">
        <th>Preamble</th>
        <th>SFD</th>
        <th>Destination Address</th>
        <th>Source Address</th>
        <th>VLAN Header</th>
        <th>Ether-Type</th>
        <th>Payload</th>
        <th>FCS</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>7 bytes</td>
        <td>1 bytes</td>
        <td>6 bytes</td>
        <td>6 bytes</td>
        <td>4 bytes</td>
        <td>2 bytes</td>
        <td>46-1500 bytes</td>
        <td>4 bytes</td>
      </tr>
      </table>
      <h5>Preamble</h5>
      <p>
        8 bytes (or 64 bits) long, and can be itself split into two sections.
      </p>
      <h5>Start Frame Delimiter (SFD)</h5>
      <p>
        is last byte of Preamble, signals to a receiving device that the
        Preamble is over and that the actual frame contents will now follow.
      </p>
      <h5>Destination MAC Address</h5>
      <p>The hardware address of the intended recipient.</p>
      <h5>Ether-type Field</h5>
      <p>
        16 bits long and used to describe the protocol of the contents of the
        frame.
      </p>
      <h5>VLAN header</h5>
      <p>
        Indicates that the frame itself is what's called a VLAN frame. If a VLAN
        header presents the Ether type field follows it.
      </p>
      <h5>Virtual LAN (VLAN)</h5>
      <p>
        A technique that lets you have a multiple logical LANs operating on the
        same physical equipment.
      </p>
      <h5>Payload</h5>
      <p>
        In networking terms, is the actual data being transported which is every
        thing that is not a header.
      </p>
      <h5>Frame Check Sequence (FCS)</h5>
      <p>
        A 4 byte or 32 bit number that represents a checksum value for the
        entire frame. This Checksum value is calculated by performing what's
        known as a cyclical redundancy check against the frame.
      </p>
      <h5>Cyclical Redundancy Check (CRC)</h5>
      <p>
        An important concept for data integrity, and is used all over computing,
        not just network transmissions.

    <h2>Ethernet and MAC Addressess</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Ethernet</h3>
      <p>
        The protocol most widely used to send data accross individual links.
      </p>
      <h3>MAC Addressess</h3>
      <p>
        A globally unique identifier attached to an individual network
        interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a 48 bit number normally represented by six groupings of two
        hexadecimal numbers.
      </p>
      <h3>Organiztionally Unique identifier (OUI)</h3>
      <p>The first three octets of a MAC Address</p>
      <p>
        Ethernet uses MAC Address to ensure that the data it sends has both an
        address for the machine that sent the transmission, as well as the one
        the transmission was intended for.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        A <strong>Unicast</strong> transmission is always meant for just one
        receiving address.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the least significant bit in the first octet of a destination address
        is set to zero, it means that the ethernet frame is intended for only
        the destination address.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the least significant bit in the first octet of a destination address
        is set to one, it means you are dealing with a <em>multicast</em> frame.
      </p>
      <p>Ethernet Broadcast address is all F's</p>
      <p>            FF:FF:FFFF:FF:FF         </p>

      <h3>Disecting an Ethernet Frame</h3>
      <h4>Data Packet</h4>
      <p>An all encompassing term that represents any single set of binary data being sent accross a network link.</p>
      <h4>Ethernet Frame</h4>
      <p>A highly structured collection of information presented in a specific order.</p>

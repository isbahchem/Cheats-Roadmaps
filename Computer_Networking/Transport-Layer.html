    <p>
      The transport layer allows traffic to be directed to specific network
      applications.
    </p>
    <h3>PORT</h3>
    <p>
      A 16-bit number that is used to direct traffic to specific services
      running on a network computer.
    </p>
    <div class="TCP-segment">
      <h2>Dissection of a TCP Segment</h2>
      <p>TCP Segment is made up of a TCP header and a data section.</p>
      <h3>Destination Port</h3>
      <p>The port of the service the traffic is intended for.</p>
      <h3>Source Port</h3>
      <p>
        A high numbered port chosen from a special section of ports known as
        ephemeral ports.
      </p>
      <p>Ephemeral Ports are identified as ports 49152 through 65535</p>
      <p>Syetem Ports are identified as ports through 1023</p>
      <h3>Sequence Number</h3>
      <p>
        A 32-bit number that is used to keep track of where in a sequence of TCP
        segments this one is expected to be.
      </p>
      <h3>Acknowledgement Number</h3>
      <p>The number of the next expected segment</p>
      <h3>Data Offset Field</h3>
      <p>
        A 4-bit number that communicates how long the TCP header for this
        segment is.
      </p>
      <h3>TCP Window (16-bit)</h3>
      <p>
        Specifies the range of sequence numbers that might be sent before an
        acknowledgement is required.
      </p>
      <h3>Urgent Pointer Field</h3>
      <p>
        Used in conjunction with one of the TCP control flags to point out
        particular segments that might be more important than others.
      </p>
      <h3>Options Field</h3>
      <p>It is sometimes used for more complicated flow control protocols.</p>
      <div style="text-align: justify; display: inline-flex; border: 1px solid red; background-color: darkseagreen;">
        <h3 style="color: cornsilk; background-color: black;  text-transform: uppercase; text-overflow: ellipsis; display: flex; border-radius: 4px; height: fit-content;">Control Flags</h3>
        <h5>URG(urgent)</h5>
        <p>
          A value of one here indicates that the segment is considered urgent
          and that the urgent pointer field has more data about this.
        </p>
        <h5>ACK(acknowledged)</h5>
        <p>
          A value of one in this field means that the acknowledgement number
          field should be examined.
        </p>
        <h5>PSH(push)</h5>
        <p>
          The transmitting device wants the receiving device to push currently
          buffered data to the application on the receiving end as soon as
          possible.
        </p>
        <h5>RST(reset)</h5>
        <p>
          One of the sides in a TCP connection hasn't been able to properly
          recover from a series of missing or malformed segments.
        </p>
        <h5>SYN(synchronize)</h5>
        <p>
          It's used when first establishing a TCP connection and makes sure the
          receiving end knows to examine the sequence number field.
        </p>
        <h5>FIN(finish)</h5>
        <p>
          When this flag is set to one, it means the transmitting computer
          doesnot have any more data to send and the connection can be closed.
